                “Open-source ERP” is an umbrella term — and that’s exactly where teams get trapped.
                Many choose by feature lists and license costs… and only later realize the real price is paid in upgrades,
                customization debt, and analytics/AI readiness.
                <br><br>
                This roundup focuses on real-world trade-offs: what works out of the box, where complexity appears,
                and how teams choose between classic ERP suites, platform-first approaches, and low-code internal tools.

              <h2>Why “open-source ERP” no longer means one single thing</h2>
                <p>
                If you read most articles about open-source ERP, it may seem that the world is still divided
                into “off-the-shelf systems” and “custom development”.
                In practice, by 2024–2025 almost nobody thinks this way anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                Companies are no longer looking for an ERP as a product.  
                They are looking for <em>a way to assemble and maintain their business systems</em>
                in an environment of constant change: processes, teams, integrations — and now AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                That’s why this list deliberately mixes ERPs, platforms, and low-code tools —
                this is exactly how they coexist in real companies today.
                </p>

                <h2>Classic ERPs: still alive, but no longer universal</h2>

                <h3>Odoo (Community Edition)</h3>
                <p>
                Odoo remains the most recognizable open-source ERP platform.
                It still works very well as an “entry point”:
                accounting, sales, inventory, basic workflows — everything is available out of the box.
                </p>
                <p>
                The problems usually start not at launch, but one or two years later.
                When the business outgrows standard scenarios, Odoo becomes
                a product you effectively maintain yourself:
                custom modules, complex upgrades, and dependency on the ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Good fit if:</strong> you need a fast start and relatively standard processes.<br>
                <strong>Poor fit if:</strong> business logic changes frequently and ERP must evolve rather than freeze.<br>

                <h3>ERPNext</h3>
                <p>
                ERPNext is often chosen by teams looking for a coherent,
                well-structured ERP without enterprise-level excess.
                It enforces discipline: if your processes fit the model,
                the system behaves predictably and reliably.
                </p>
                <p>
                The price of that predictability is flexibility.
                ERPNext does not like being constantly bent to new operating models.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Good fit if:</strong> the business is ready to standardize.<br>
                <strong>Poor fit if:</strong> processes are unstable and change frequently.<br>

                <h2>Platform-first ERP: when ERP is the result, not the product</h2>

                <h3>MyCompany (lsFusion)</h3>
                <p>
                More and more teams are realizing that ERP as a “boxed product”
                does not survive real life very well: changing processes, new channels,
                automation, and AI.
                </p>
                <p>
                MyCompany is an example of a platform-first approach.
                Formally it is an ERP, but in essence it is a way to describe business logic
                so that it can evolve without rewriting the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                This becomes especially important in an AI-driven context.
                Declarative, transparent logic is easier to analyze,
                explain, and automate — both for humans and AI tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Good fit if:</strong> ERP must grow and transform together with the business.<br>
                <strong>Poor fit if:</strong> you want a “set it and forget it” ERP.<br>

                <h3>Tryton</h3>
                <p>
                Tryton is less popular, but architecturally very clean.
                It is often chosen by teams that want full control over the data model
                and are not afraid to write code.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is not a fast start, but a solid foundation for long-lived systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Good fit if:</strong> you have an engineering team and a long-term horizon.<br>
                <strong>Poor fit if:</strong> you need ERP “yesterday”.<br>

                OFBiz is rarely used as a ready-made ERP.
                More often it serves as a foundation for building custom business systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                It offers freedom, but requires a mature team and architectural discipline.

                <h2>Low-code and internal tools: how ERP is built in practice</h2>

                <h3>ToolJet</h3>
                <p>
                ToolJet is a good example of how companies actually build
                “ERP-like” systems today.
                Not a single monolith, but a set of internal interfaces
                connected to data and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is not ERP in the classical sense,
                but this is often what a modern business operating system looks like.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Good fit if:</strong> ERP is a collection of internal tools.<br>
                <strong>Poor fit if:</strong> you need a single monolithic accounting core.<br>

                </p>

                <h3>NocoBase</h3>
                <p>
                NocoBase appears in similar scenarios to ToolJet,
                but with a stronger focus on extensibility and plugins.
                </p>
                <p>
                It is chosen when ERP is an ecosystem of internal applications,
                not a single system.

                <h3>Budibase</h3>
                <p>
                Budibase occupies a similar niche — rapid creation
                of internal admin panels and operational interfaces.

                <h2>Conclusion: How choices were made in 2025</h2>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>If you need fast results:</strong> a ready-made ERP.</li>
                <li><strong>If ERP is a living organism:</strong> a platform-first approach.</li>
                <li><strong>If ERP is a toolbox:</strong> low-code and internal tools.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                In reality, many companies use a <em>combination</em> of all three.
                And this is the main trend of recent years.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Conclusion: how to choose in 2026 (without illusions)</h2>

                <p>
                The key mistake when choosing ERP in 2025
                was believing that there is one “correct” system
                that will solve everything once and for all.
                </p>

                <p>
                Reality is different: modern companies build
                <strong>a business systems architecture</strong>,
                where ERP is not a product, but a layer of logic and data.
                </p>

                <ol>
                <li>
                <strong>If you need fast results right now</strong><br>
                Choose a ready-made ERP and <em>consciously limit customization</em>.
                This is a decision about speed, not perfect process alignment.
                </li>

                <li>
                <strong>If the business changes constantly</strong><br>
                Look for a platform-first approach.
                It is critical that business logic is
                <em>declarative, readable, and explainable</em> —
                not only for developers, but also for AI tools,
                which increasingly participate in analysis, automation, and system support.
                </li>

                <li>
                <strong>If ERP in practice is a set of internal tools</strong><br>
                Low-code and internal tools are no longer “temporary solutions”,
                but a full-fledged operational layer.
                They allow new needs to be addressed quickly
                without rewriting the system core.
                </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                Important: companies <strong>do not use all three approaches chaotically</strong>.
                Usually one becomes the <em>core</em>,
                while the others serve as supporting layers.
                </p>

                <p>
                This is why more attention is paid to
                <strong>readability and formalization of business logic</strong>.
                What cannot be clearly described
                cannot be reliably automated —
                neither manually nor with AI.
                </p>

                <h3>What an owner should understand before choosing</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>How often do key business processes change?</li>
                <li>Should the system <em>explain</em> its decisions to humans and AI?</li>
                <li>Is the business ready to live inside someone else’s model — or develop its own?</li>
                <li>Is ERP just an accounting tool, or the foundation of operational management?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                The answers to these questions matter more than any feature list.
                They determine whether the system
                will support business growth — or slow it down.
                </p>
