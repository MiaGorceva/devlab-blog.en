                Top 12 Open-Source ERP &amp; Business Systems (That People Actually Use)
              </h1>

              <p class="hero-text">
                “Open-source ERP” is an umbrella term. In practice, it can mean anything from installing
                a ready-made suite to building a business system on top of a flexible platform.
                <br><br>
                This article focuses on real-world trade-offs: what works out of the box, where complexity appears,
                and how different teams choose between classic ERP systems and platform-based approaches.
              </p>

            <section class="post-content">

              <h2>How this list was selected (without marketing fluff)</h2>
              <p>
                The systems below were selected using a mix of long-term community adoption,
                visibility in developer ecosystems, and a simple practical question:
                can real teams implement and evolve these systems without reshaping their entire organization around the tool?
              </p>

              <h2>Quick map: three categories teams often confuse</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Ready ERP suites:</strong> install, configure, and operate — best when you need an ERP quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>ERP platforms:</strong> extend and model business logic — best when processes are non-standard.</li>
                <li><strong>Business system builders:</strong> low-code foundations for assembling ERP-like internal tools.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>The Top 12</h2>

              <h3>1) Odoo (Community Edition)</h3>
              <p>
                Often the default starting point for open-source ERP.
                Odoo offers a vast ecosystem of modules and integrations, but deeper customization
                quickly turns into a long-term engineering effort.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> modular ERP adoption in SMB environments.<br>
                 <strong>Watch out for:</strong> customization complexity and long-term maintenance.</p>

              <h3>2) ERPNext</h3>
              <p>
                A clean, integrated ERP suite popular with small and mid-sized companies.
                It provides solid coverage for accounting, inventory, sales, and manufacturing.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Best for:</strong> teams that want a strong out-of-the-box ERP baseline.</p>

              <h3>3) MyCompany (lsFusion)</h3>
                <p>
                  MyCompany represents a platform-first approach to ERP, designed around how modern teams actually work.
                  Instead of forcing processes into a rigid structure, it allows companies to assemble business logic
                  from ready-made modules and evolve it as requirements change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What makes this approach increasingly relevant is how naturally it aligns with AI-driven workflows.
                  Business logic is defined in a clear, declarative way, which makes it easier for AI tools to analyze,
                  explain, assist with changes, and even generate parts of the system as processes evolve.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice, this works well for organizations where processes are fluid, decisions are data-driven,
                  and automation is expected to grow over time — not as a bolt-on feature, but as part of the system’s core.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Best for:</strong> teams building ERP systems that are expected to adapt, integrate with AI tools,
                  and remain understandable as complexity grows.<br>
