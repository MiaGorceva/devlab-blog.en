                An independent, founder-oriented review of why ERP projects become expensive after 12–24 months, where vendor lock-in really comes from,

            <section class="post-content">
              <h2 id="why-erp-breaks">Why ERP gets expensive later (not at go-live)</h2>
              <p>
                Most ERP projects don’t fail on day one. They fail quietly after go-live — when the business starts changing faster than the system can follow.
                The first year looks fine: documents exist, roles are set, reporting “kind of” works. Then reality arrives:
                new discount logic, new sales channels, new approval routes, new contract types, new profitability views, new operational constraints.
              </p>
              <p>
                The uncomfortable pattern is simple: in many ERP setups, <strong>every meaningful business change becomes a software project</strong>.
                And if a change requires a project, it also requires timeline, budget, testing cycles, and someone “who knows how it works”.
                That’s the real cost driver — not the license line.
              </p>

              <h2 id="definition">What “ERP that doesn’t break when business changes” actually means</h2>
              <p>
                Founders don’t need buzzwords — they need predictability. A change-friendly ERP is not a prettier UI.
                It’s an ERP where <strong>business rules live as rules</strong> (clear dependencies, constraints, calculations),
                not as scattered custom code, hidden processing steps, and fragile report formulas.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Bad ERP experience:</strong> change a rule → break three reports → patch integrations → discover edge cases → repeat.</li>
                <li><strong>Good ERP experience:</strong> change a rule → the system recalculates consistently → reporting stays aligned.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 id="comparison-table">Comparison: what typically happens in 1C / SAP / Dynamics / Odoo</h2>
              <p>
                This is not a “best ERP” ranking. It’s a reality check: what often happens <em>after 12–24 months</em> in real projects,
                once customizations accumulate and “business-as-usual change” becomes routine.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <strong>Quick note on SAP:</strong> yes, SAP has been moving towards extension models (BTP, side-by-side, modern UI layers).
                But in practice, many real landscapes still depend heavily on legacy customization patterns — and the cost of change remains a core management issue.

              <h2 id="mini-cases">Mini-cases: the changes that look small but cost real money</h2>

              <h3 id="case-discounts">Case 1 — discounts with 5 conditions (and they change weekly)</h3>
              <p>
                The business asks for pricing rules based on client tier, region, product group, volume, payment terms — and exceptions.
                In many ERP setups, this turns into a chain of special cases. Reports drift. Managers “work around” the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                A change-friendly design keeps pricing as <strong>explicit rule logic</strong> — consistent across documents, calculations, and reporting.
              </p>

              <h3 id="case-approvals">Case 2 — approvals that reflect real management (not the UI)</h3>
              <p>
                “If amount &gt; X → CFO approval. If the client is new → risk review. If overdue &gt; N days → accounting approval.”
                These are normal operational rules. Yet many systems implement approvals as UI workflows disconnected from data and constraints.
                Result: stuck statuses, unclear responsibility, invisible bottlenecks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Robust design treats approvals as <strong>policy rules</strong> tied to data conditions — not a fragile layer of buttons.
              </p>

              <h3 id="case-profitability">Case 3 — profitability that matches reality (not just reports)</h3>
              <p>
                This is the founder moment: “Why does the report show profit but cash says otherwise?”
                The root cause is usually scattered logic: partial cost allocation, inconsistent discount handling, logistic costs applied elsewhere,
                retroactive adjustments, or “re-post to fix”.
              </p>
              <p>
                If core calculations are consistent and derived from the same rules, profitability becomes explainable — and fixable.
              </p>

              <h3 id="case-new-entity">Case 4 — adding a new entity (subscription / service contract / bundle)</h3>
              <p>
                “Just add a new document type” sounds easy. In practice, a new entity must participate in reporting, pricing, approvals, KPIs,
                constraints, and audit logic. If logic is scattered, every new entity triggers a cascade of changes.
              </p>

              <h2 id="ai-angle">The AI angle founders actually care about</h2>
              <p>
                Not “a chatbot in ERP”. The useful AI story is simpler: <strong>business logic should be readable enough</strong>
                that an analyst — assisted by AI (acting like a junior engineer) — can implement and validate many changes without becoming hostage to a single developer
                or integrator.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <strong>Reality check:</strong> AI can’t reliably help when your ERP rules are scattered across custom code, hidden processing steps,
                one-off report formulas, and undocumented “special cases”. AI becomes useful when logic is structured as explicit rules and dependencies.
              </div>

              <h2 id="risk-checklist">Founder checklist: are you already in the danger zone?</h2>
              <p>Tick what matches your situation:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Meaningful changes take 2–6 weeks “for some reason”.</li>
                <li>Numbers differ across reports, exports, and dashboards.</li>
                <li>The team avoids touching rules (“it might break something”).</li>
                <li>1–2 people “know everything” and become a bottleneck.</li>
                <li>Changes require full-cycle retesting across unrelated areas.</li>
                <li>Integrations duplicate logic and create data drift.</li>
                <li>Part of operations works outside ERP because it’s faster.</li>
                <li>New business ideas quickly turn into “not possible”.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                If you have <strong>4+</strong> items: you don’t have a “bad ERP”.
                You have a system where <strong>the cost of change is becoming your hidden tax</strong>.
              </p>

              <h2 id="what-to-do">What to do (without buzzwords)</h2>
              <h3>1) Evaluate ERP by the cost of change, not by feature lists</h3>
              <p>
                The right question isn’t “does it support feature X”. It’s:
                <strong>how fast can we change business rules safely in six months?</strong>
              </p>

              <h3>2) Ask for three live demos of “hard changes”</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Add a new discount rule with a new condition.</li>
                <li>Change an approval route based on policy logic.</li>
                <li>Add a new entity that must appear in reports and KPIs.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                If the answer is always “we need a separate project / discovery / a developer for that” — treat that as a real signal.
              </p>

              <h3>3) Avoid lock-in by demanding explicit business logic</h3>
              <p>
                Ask: where do rules live? How are dependencies tracked? How do we ensure reports and calculations remain aligned?
                If nobody can explain it simply, you’re buying opacity.
              </p>
